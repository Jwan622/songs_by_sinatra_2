1)  Run ruby main.rb to see the page shown in Figure 3.2.
That doesn't work. I can't get to the songs page. I have an error message that shows up in my browser that syas
that I am calling "join" on a string.

2) From the tutorial: "For Sinatra to be involved, we need to require the song.rb file in our main.rb file from Chapter 2. Make sure that song.rb is saved in the same directory as main.rb, and add this line to the top of main.rb:"

Does this mean that I need to put song.rb in the Chapter2 root folder or does this mean that I need to migrate over all the files from Chapter2 and put them in chapter 3? All the future code blocks in jumpstart lab have "chapter3/main.rb" in the top right...
So what do I do? Should I just rename the chapter2 folder chapter 3 and keep coding from there?
